# pusher_channels_flutter_example

Demonstrates how to use the pusher_channels_flutter plugin
at https://github.com/pusher/pusher-channels-flutter

## Getting Started

This is a minimal Flutter example project for [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels). Please note that it is not production ready.


For tutorials and more in-depth information about Pusher Channels, visit our [official docs](https://pusher.com/docs/channels).

## Notes

Please note that when subscribing to a private or presence
channel, you need to enable authentication,
this can be done by setting the `authEndPoint` parameter
(see `main.dart`). For setting up an auth endpoint please
check:

https://github.com/pusher/pusher-channels-flutter#authendpoint-string

It's also possible to authenticate in the app itself, by
implementing the `onAuthorizer` callback, for more information see here:
